      "description": "Designed a sliding-puzzle game in Verilog. The game displays a 4 x 4 board where only numbers from 1 to 15 are randomly assigned, the player can move squares in 4 directions by 4 buttons on the breadboard to make the numbers in order. Implemented time countdown and move counter to display time left and moves used on the breadboard.",

        "Twitter App: Developed a java application that can create, read, delete tweets from CLI. Utilized Twitter REST API by DAO layer. Handled the business logic by Service layer. Parsed CLI input to call corresponding service methods by Controller layer. Implemented Spring framework using Spring Boot to manage the classes by IoC container.",
        "JDBC App: Implemented CRUD process for a database in a PSQL instance by a java program. Coded JDBC to connect to the database, customer DAO to handle CRUD process, docker container to contain the PSQL instance.",
        "Grep App: Implemented a simple grep app in Java. The app searches for a text pattern recursively in a given directory, and output matched lines to a file. Used slf4j library for log, and regex library to search the pattern. overridden the methods that return a list of all files in a given directory and a list of all strings in a file using Lambda and Stream APIs. Dockerized the grep app by docker and push the image to Docker for easier distribution."
